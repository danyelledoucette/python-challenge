## PyPoll

* Help a small, rural town modernize its vote counting process using a set of poll data called [election_data.csv]. The dataset is composed of three columns: `Voter ID`, `County`, and `Candidate`. 

Create a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following:

  * The total number of votes cast

  * A complete list of candidates who received votes

  * The percentage of votes each candidate won

  * The total number of votes each candidate won

  * The winner of the election based on popular vote.
